    <h2 style="font-family:Georgia;">Why younger people should vote more often!</h2>
    <p style="font-family:'Courier New'; font-size:20px;">People who are aged 18-34 will make up over 40 million of the potential voters in 2024. It is critical that they vote since they are the future of democarcy. 
      Part of the young electorate’s strength is its diversity. Today’s young voters are the most diverse in American history and the most diverse group in our electorate. Their multifaceted perspectives also allow them to bring fresh approaches to topics like the economy, gun reform, and abortion justice.
     Mobilizing them to vote empowers them to use these fresh approaches to introduce innovative solutions into our democracy.

    <h2 style="font-family:Georgia;" >Why Older People should continue to Vote!</h2>
    <p style="font-family:'Courier New'; font-size:20px;">In the U.S., citizens are more likely to vote as they age. With the U.S. in another presidential election year, the demographic with the highest turnout will have the most sway over results. When a certain demographic participates at a higher rate than any other, it tends to carry relatively more political clout. This does not mean that all seniors vote the same way and thus decide elections. People do not suddenly abandon their lifelong political philosophies and vote in lockstep just because they have reached a certain advanced age. The senior vote is quite diverse, and statistics from past elections actually confirm that voting preferences among the elderly do not differ significantly from those of the general population. The lesson for the rest of us is that democracy can work.

    <h2 style="font-family:Georgia;">Why We Need People of All Ages to Vote!</h2>
    <p style="font-family:'Courier New'; font-size:20px;">No matter which state we’re in, we must ensure all our voices are represented in our democracy. That includes our most diverse and activism-oriented voters – the same ones who’ll inherit our nation. 
      They deserve to shape their futures. It’s our job to support them. Voting together with your neighbors, family, and friends ensures that your shared values and issues are prioritized, that you play a key role in choosing who represents us, and where government funding and resources will go.
